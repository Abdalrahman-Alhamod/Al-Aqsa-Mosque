## Overview

The Al Aqsa Mosque OpenGL Project is committed to ensuring the security and privacy of its users and contributors. This security policy outlines the best practices and guidelines to maintain a secure development and operational environment.

## Access Control

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Ensure strong authentication mechanisms for project contributors.
   - Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights.
   - Regularly review and update access control lists.

2. **Sensitive Information:**
   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) in the code.
   - Store sensitive information securely using industry-standard encryption.

## Code Security

1. **Code Review:**
   - Enforce a code review process for all contributions to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
   - Use static code analysis tools to identify potential security issues.

2. **Dependency Management:**
   - Regularly update and patch dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
   - Maintain a list of approved and vetted third-party libraries.

## Data Protection

1. **Data Encryption:**
   - Use secure encryption mechanisms for the storage and transmission of sensitive data.
   - Implement HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

2. **Data Retention:**
   - Define and adhere to a data retention policy to manage the lifecycle of stored data.
   - Regularly audit and purge unnecessary data.

## Infrastructure Security

1. **Server Security:**
   - Keep server software, operating systems, and dependencies up-to-date.
   - Implement firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems.

2. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Enable logging for critical events and regularly review logs for unusual activities.
   - Implement monitoring solutions to detect and respond to security incidents.

## Incident Response

1. **Incident Reporting:**
   - Establish clear procedures for reporting security incidents promptly.
   - Encourage a culture of reporting potential security issues without fear of retribution.

2. **Incident Investigation:**
   - Conduct thorough investigations into reported security incidents.
   - Document lessons learned and update security measures based on findings.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Privately Report:**
   - Privately disclose security vulnerabilities to the project maintainers.
   - Avoid disclosing security issues publicly until a fix has been implemented.

2. **Provide Details:**
   - Clearly document the vulnerability with detailed information.
   - Include steps to reproduce the issue for better understanding.

3. **Cooperate with Fixing:**
   - Collaborate with project maintainers to verify and implement fixes.
   - Allow a reasonable timeframe for fixing before disclosing the issue publicly.

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the efforts of the security community in identifying and responsibly disclosing security issues.

**Note:** This security policy is subject to change, and contributors are encouraged to review it regularly for updates.
